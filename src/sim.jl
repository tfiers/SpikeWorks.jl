Caveat for this file: imagine it's encapsulated in a `module SingleNeuron`.
or equivalently, types are prefixed, like `SingleNeuronModel`, `SingleNeuronRecording`.

I'll encapsulate and extract what's reusable later, when testing net sim.
(What'll be: most of init & step. Counter. The type division).

#
# `isequal` → `==` → `===`. The latter is automatically defined for immutable structs as:
# do they have the same contents (at bit level).
# This is indeed what we'd say: two spikes are equal if same source, and same time.


# Ideas to make better [but not necessary now]:
# - `vars, Dₜvars = neuron_state`
#    i.e. define iterator interface on NeuronState. (See how Pair does it).
#    (It's also cool, "first" and "second" derivative (no, it's 0th and 1st, but w/e))
# - Allow funcs(vars,Dₜvars) for spike_cond and on_self_spike! (and time as well ig :))
#   (yeah, just a wrapper in NeuronModel, used for all three F,G,H).
# - To check: does nonzero t₀ actually work (interaction with spiketrains eg)
#
# - Spike struct, with isless. So no sortperm needed to mux.
# - There's sth not quite right with NeuronModel.vars_t₀. Cause you can have model eqs,
#   sim a bit, and then start running again, with diff "starting" values.
#
# - "SimState" is ehh. Cause I'd think that would just be time + vars (neuronstate).
#   Instead it has refs to recording, and steps..
#   It's sth like "SimRunInfo".
#   `completed(simrun)` makes more sense too. (:)
#     #[[magic of programming: if langauge doesnt' sit right,
#     then software design isn't either]])
#   Ok yes, that'd be better. but notnow.
#   ah, time might go with NeuronState yeh



# - "Here we've used the Julia convention that function that mutate their arguments end in
#    an exclamation mark".


# struct Time{T}
#     t::T
# end
# Base.convert(::Type{Time, t) = Time(float(t))
#
# Cool, not now (we'd have to implement many ::Float methods)



# You can type the `₀` as \_0<tab>



# NeuronState{V}(x::V, ẋ::V) where V <: AbstractVector = begin
#     @test length(x) == length(ẋ)
#     new(x, ẋ)
# end
# ↓
# so verbose, just to check if equal lengths


# [on field `system` of Simulation]:
# Ok, could be called `model` too. Eh, though: `.inputs`, not really.
# otoh, in step! it's quite cool:
#   model.neuron.f!()
#   model.on_spike_arrival!()
#
# maybe something: ?
#   (model, inputs) = system
#
# fucking hell yes that's cool
#
# it's kinda, boundary conditions
# vars_t₀ is also a bit hm, in neuronmodel; would it be better in inputs?
# or is it three things:
#   (model, inputs, x₀) = system
# Yes that sounds good.


# rename humanrepr to humanshow. add IO arg

# I'm thinking:
# - Every type has "oneline" summary
# - And those are used recursively for properties
# You can then zoom in on properties
# (and display multilevel if you want; colours and types, …)
